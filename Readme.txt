Problem statement: Analysis of various Clustering algorithms in R
Solution Statement: Applying Kmeans, K-Medoids and Agglomerative coefficient on 'Heart Disease' dataset to visualize a comparative analysis betwee the clustering methods.
Technology used: RStudio
Results achieved: K-Mediods is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-means and Agglomerative coefficient. Agnes works better for small datasets.
